# MLPR Assignment Repository

Repository contents:
- Completed Jupyter notebooks: `asg1.ipynb`, `asg2.ipynb`, `asg3.ipynb`, `Lab 4 Spring 2026 AI3011.ipynb`, `Lab 5 Spring 2026.ipynb`
- Supporting images used in analysis.

## Aim
Summarise aims of the assignment: explore image processing and machine learning techniques applied in the course labs and assignments, perform data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and report results and conclusions.

## Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization using pandas and plotly/matplotlib.
- Preprocessing steps and feature extraction shown inside each notebook (e.g., image normalization, Haar cascade face detection where used).
- Models and algorithms (as implemented in notebooks) were trained and evaluated; please open the notebooks to see code, outputs and answers to report questions.

## Key findings and conclusions
- Notebooks contain the analysis, results, visualizations and short conclusions for each lab/assignment.
- Visual artifacts used in the report (examples):

## How to create a public GitHub repository and push these files
1. Create a new public repository on GitHub named e.g. `mlpr-assignment`.
2. In your local workspace (/Users/kanavnanda/Downloads/mlpr) run the following (or use GitHub CLI):

- Add a remote and push the existing commits to GitHub.

3. Verify the repository is public by visiting the GitHub URL.

Note: All notebooks already include code, outputs, analysis and answers. Open each `.ipynb` file in Jupyter or VS Code to review.

## Files
- asg1.ipynb
- asg2.ipynb
- asg3.ipynb
- Lab 4 Spring 2026 AI3011.ipynb
- Lab 5 Spring 2026.ipynb

If you want, I can attempt to create the remote GitHub repository and push (this requires that the GitHub CLI is installed and you are authenticated), or provide the exact commands to run in the terminal. Let me know which you prefer.
